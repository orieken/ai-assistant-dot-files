# Contract: context-manifest.md

**Produced by**: context-engineer
**Consumed by**: analyst, architect, developer, and every other pipeline agent (all read it first, per their
own "Context To Load First" sections)

## Required Sections (exact heading text and level)
- `## 1. Scope and Boundaries`
- `## 2. Pinpoint Files (To Keep Open)`
- `## 3. Global Rules and Constraints`
- `## 4. Knowledge Items & ADRs (To Load)`
- `## 5. Prior Deliveries in This Bounded Context`
- `## 6. Prune Recommendations (To Close)`
- `## 7. Token Budget`

## Validation Rule
- `## 7. Token Budget` must contain a `**Status**` line with value `OK` or `WARNING` — never blank and
  never any other value. If `WARNING`, a `**Cut recommendations**` line must also be present (per
  `context-engineer`'s own guardrail: never report a budget without cut recommendations to back it up).
- `## 5. Prior Deliveries in This Bounded Context` must not be empty — it must contain either at least one
  feature reference or the literal phrase "No prior deliveries found in this bounded context" (per
  `context-engineer`'s own guardrail: never skip this section silently).

This is a structural check only. It does not verify the Pinpoint Files are actually the *right* files, or
that the token estimate is accurate — that's judgment, caught downstream if analyst or developer finds the
manifest missing something relevant (see `context-audit` for after-the-fact waste analysis).

## Retrieval Frontmatter (WARN)

Pipeline artifacts should include a YAML frontmatter block at the very top of the file. Missing or incomplete retrieval frontmatter triggers a **WARN** from `validate-artifact` — not a FAIL. Existing archived artifacts without frontmatter are unaffected.

```yaml
---
feature: "<feature-name>"             # kebab-case slug derived from the feature file name
bounded_context: "<context>"          # owning bounded context (from DOMAIN_DICTIONARY.md domain list)
domain_terms: []                      # canonical terms from DOMAIN_DICTIONARY.md used in this feature
files_touched: []                     # repo-relative paths of files created or modified
issue_refs: []                        # ticket/issue references (e.g., PROJ-123, #456)
linked_adrs: []                       # repo-root-relative paths to referenced ADRs
linked_kis: []                        # repo-root-relative paths to referenced Knowledge Items
---
```

Once frontmatter adoption is visible across a project's feature archive, this check will be promoted to FAIL in a future release.
