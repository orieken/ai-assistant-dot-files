// Reset-on-edit (roadmap L2.14). All eight prose gates declare "any edit to
// the pending artifact resets the gate"; until now nothing enforced it, so
// an edited artifact demoted its stage while the approval survived and the
// gated stage proceeded on a decision about content that no longer exists.
//
// An approval binds to the digests it was given. Before a gated stage
// starts, those digests are checked against what is on disk: a mismatch,
// or a vanished artifact, invalidates the approval and the run halts at the
// gate again. A stage that re-runs to a byte-identical artifact leaves its
// digest unchanged and keeps the approval — the rule is "any edit resets
// the gate", not "any re-run".

// digest verification just demoted. This is the primary detection point,
// not the barrier: verification runs before the demoted stage re-runs, and
// a re-run overwrites the edited file — so checking only at the barrier
// would let an agent's fresh output mask the edit that caused it.
//
// A write that changes nothing demotes nothing (the digest still matches),
// so an identical re-run still leaves the approval standing.
