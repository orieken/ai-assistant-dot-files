// Policy wiring for `loom run` (roadmap L2.16).
//
// Policies are loaded, evaluated at each gate, and reported. Nothing acts
// on them: the run halts at every gate exactly as it did before. What
// changes is that a human at the barrier is told what a policy would have
// decided, and the decision is recorded — which is the audit trail
// approval-gates.md has asserted since v3.3 without ever producing one.
