# Context, Memory & Learning Guide

This runbook covers three related but distinct concerns in this framework, and is the map for how they fit
together:
- **Context** — what's loaded into an agent's window for the current turn/run. Solves "is this agent
  looking at the right, minimal set of files right now."
- **Memory** — durable knowledge that outlives any single run. Solves "has this already been figured out
  somewhere, so we don't re-derive it."
- **Learning** — feedback loops that change future agent behavior based on past runs. Solves "will the next
  similar feature actually go better than this one did."

Conflating these three is the most common mistake: a well-pruned context window (this run went smoothly)
says nothing about whether the framework is *learning* from that run for next time, and a rich memory corpus
(KIs, ADRs) says nothing about whether any given agent's context window is actually well-scoped today.

`context-engineer` (`shared/agents/context-engineer.md`) is the agent responsible for Context; it also reads
Memory (Knowledge Items, ADRs, prior deliveries) to build a better manifest, but does not itself produce
Learning — that's a separate, mostly-periodic set of mechanisms covered in section 3 below.

## 1. Context

### When to Use
- Before launching a new agent pipeline or feature task.
- When an agent becomes slow, starts repeating itself, or shows signs of context drift (forgetting
  guidelines or earlier instructions).
- To optimize token consumption and reduce execution latency.

### The Context Challenge
LLMs operate on a finite context window. Reasoning accuracy and instruction-following degrade as the window
fills with noise, even well before the hard token limit:
- **Context Drift**: as conversation history grows, earlier instructions, architecture rules, and specs
  lose influence over the model's responses.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: unrelated files, redundant logs, and full directory listings reduce the
  density of relevant information, causing errors.

### Context Taxonomy
Context is categorized into six layers, ordered from permanent/static to ephemeral/dynamic. This taxonomy
describes what's loaded *right now* — it is not where things are durably stored (that's Memory, section 2).

| Layer | Name | Source | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | System Context | `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules` and equivalents per platform | Session-long |
| 2 | Rule Context | `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`, `shared/rules/` | Session-long |
| 3 | Knowledge Context | `shared/knowledge/` + `.claude/knowledge/` KIs, `docs/adrs/` | Demand-driven |
| 4 | Task/Goal Context | Feature spec, `analysis.md` | Task-long |
| 5 | Historical Context | Thread history, `docs/features/` | Ephemeral |
| 6 | Runtime Context | Open files, tool outputs | Real-time |

### Core Principles

1. **Principle of Least Context (Least Privilege)** — agents load only what's necessary for the immediate
   sub-task. Don't read entire directories recursively when only an interface matters. Don't read a whole
   500+ line file when only a 50-line section matters — use line-range reads. Don't keep unrelated files
   open.
2. **Proactive RAG** — before independent analysis or design, check whether the problem is already solved.
   `context-engineer` invokes the `search-ki` skill, which searches `shared/knowledge/`, `.claude/knowledge/`,
   and `docs/adrs/` together (see section 2 — this is a Memory lookup performed as part of building Context).
3. **State Externalization** — don't force an agent to hold long checklists or detailed state in the active
   conversation. This framework's actual externalization mechanism is
   `.claude/feature-workspace/pipeline-state.json` (resumability, read by `resume-pipeline`) and
   `.claude/feature-workspace/pipeline-trace.json` (timing/iteration history, read by `pipeline-retrospective`
   and `agent-scorecard`) — see `shared/skills/deliver-feature/SKILL.md`, "Checkpointing & Pipeline State."
   Each pipeline artifact (`analysis.md`, `architecture-notes.md`, etc.) is itself an externalization of that
   agent's reasoning, handed off structurally rather than kept in conversation.
4. **Dynamic Context Loading (Just-in-Time)** — load files when needed, summarize once processed. An
   artifact 2+ pipeline phases old gets read via `summarize-artifact` (a ~200-word gist) instead of in full —
   this is "Context Decay," see `shared/skills/deliver-feature/SKILL.md`.
5. **Isolation of Subagent Boundaries** — spawning a subagent is a clean slate: it sees only its own
   definition and the specific artifact/task handed to it, never the orchestrator's full history or another
   subagent's internal reasoning. The orchestrator only ever consumes a subagent's final structured report
   (see `shared/knowledge/subagent-isolation-is-a-hard-boundary.md`).

`context-engineer` is the agent responsible for keeping Layers 3-6 high-signal before the rest of the
pipeline starts. Its output, `context-manifest.md`, has a required structure enforced by
`shared/contracts/context-manifest-contract.md` via `validate-artifact` — the same structural gate every
other pipeline artifact gets.

## 2. Memory

Durable knowledge, each with its own storage location and retrieval mechanism. These don't compete with each
other — each answers a different question about the past.

| Mechanism | Answers | Stored In | Retrieved By | Distinct From |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Knowledge Items (KIs) | "Has this pattern/bug/decision already been solved?" | `shared/knowledge/` (portable), `.claude/knowledge/` (project-specific) | `search-ki` — tag/domain pre-filter, then LLM judgment read, no embeddings (see `search-ki`'s own guardrails for why) | ADRs — a KI is a reusable pattern or fix, not a rationale for a specific past choice |
| ADRs | "Why did we choose X over Y?" | `docs/adrs/` | `search-ki` (same call, treated as first-class alongside KIs) | KIs |
| `DOMAIN_DICTIONARY.md` | "What's the correct term for this concept?" | `shared/DOMAIN_DICTIONARY.md` | Read directly by every agent at a fixed process step | `TEAM_TOPOLOGY.md` — vocabulary, not org structure |
| `TEAM_TOPOLOGY.md` | "Who owns this bounded context, and how should a crossing into it work?" | `shared/TEAM_TOPOLOGY.md` | `architect` (Context Crossings) and `team-topology-check` | `DOMAIN_DICTIONARY.md` |
| `docs/features/` archive | "What actually happened when we built this before?" | `docs/features/<name>/` (all persisted pipeline artifacts, including `retrospective.md`) | Two complementary checks: `context-engineer` step 4 greps for prior deliveries in the *same bounded context*, recency-independent; `analyst` step 5 separately skims the 3 *most recent* deliveries for general process trends (see `docs/runbooks/scaling-cross-feature-learning.md` for how the bounded-context lookup scales) | `pipeline-state.json`/`pipeline-trace.json` — ephemeral, per-run only, not a durable narrative |
| `pipeline-state.json` / `pipeline-trace.json` | "Where did this specific run get to, and how long did each step take?" | `.claude/feature-workspace/` (ephemeral, one active run at a time) | `resume-pipeline` (state, for resuming/rolling back), `pipeline-retrospective` + `agent-scorecard` (trace, aggregated across many runs) | `docs/features/` — this is raw per-run data, not a written narrative |

---

## 3. Learning

Feedback loops that change future agent behavior. These are mostly periodic or manually triggered, not
wired into every single `deliver-feature` run — running all of them on every delivery would be its own kind
of over-engineering for a mechanism most features don't need triggered that often.

| Mechanism | Answers | Cadence | Persists To | Distinct From |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `retrospective` | "How did this one delivery go?" (qualitative narrative) | Auto-invoked every 5th delivery, or on request | `docs/features/<name>/retrospective.md` | `pipeline-retrospective` — single delivery, not cross-delivery trends |
| `pipeline-retrospective` | "Is an agent getting slower or more retried over time, across many deliveries?" | Manual, periodic | `docs/pipeline-retrospectives/` | `agent-scorecard` — timing/iteration, not quality |
| `agent-scorecard` | "Was an agent's *output* actually good this month, across real deliveries?" | Manual, monthly | `docs/agent-metrics/scorecard-<YYYY-MM>.md` | `agent-eval` — real deliveries, not a fixed fixture |
| `agent-eval` | "Did editing this agent's prompt just regress it on a known case?" | Run right after editing a `shared/agents/*.md` file | `docs/agent-metrics/evals/<agent>-eval-<date>.md` | `agent-scorecard` — one fixed fixture, not a trend across real deliveries |
| `extract-lessons` | "Is there a recurring finding across many deliveries worth promoting to a rule, prompt change, or new KI?" | Manual, periodic | `docs/lessons-learned/` (gated by `shared/rules/approval-gates.md`) | `retrospective` — cross-delivery pattern mining, not one delivery's story |

The through-line: `retrospective` and `docs/features/` (Memory) capture what happened; `pipeline-retrospective`
and `agent-scorecard` judge whether it's trending better or worse; `agent-eval` catches an immediate prompt
regression; `extract-lessons` is the mechanism that actually closes the loop — turning a recurring pattern
into a permanent change (a new rule, an edited prompt, or a new KI) rather than a one-time observation.

## Verification
To confirm context is well-managed on an active run:
- `context-manifest.md` passes `shared/contracts/context-manifest-contract.md` (checked automatically by
  `validate-artifact` in `deliver-feature`, step 7).
- The active open files only belong to the component currently being modified.
- Terminal/command output in context is concise (use filters, `head`, or limit counts like `git log -n 5`).
- No duplicate copies of the same file or guideline exist across the loaded context.
- Run `context-audit` after a delivery to check whether pinned files were actually referenced, and whether
  any large file was loaded without a line-range constraint.
