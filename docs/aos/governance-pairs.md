# AOS Governance Pairs & Counter-Auditors

This document maps the **15 Producer / Counter Governance Pairs** established in `docs/aos/AOS_Governance_Design_Pack/01-Governance-Checks-and-Balances.md` to concrete agents, skills, and invocation entrypoints in `ai-assistant-dot-files`.

> **Core Rule**: Every producer role (an agent generating an artifact or a human authoring a markdown specification) is paired with an independent counter role (an auditor agent or opposing-force skill) that inspects and reports findings without mutating the producer's artifact.

## Invocation Modes

1. **Standalone Audit Pass**: Any counter-auditor agent can be invoked standalone (e.g. `context-auditor`, `privacy-auditor`) to produce an audit report.
2. **Opt-In `validate-artifact` Integration**: When configured via `.claude/validate-artifact.yaml` or `.claude/delivery-policy.yaml`, `validate-artifact` automatically triggers the corresponding counter auditor after structural validation passes.
3. **Event-Driven Hooks**: Hooks in `.claude/hooks/` (or `shared/hooks/examples/`) trigger counter agents on pipeline events (such as `on-validation-pass` or `on-ki-created`).
